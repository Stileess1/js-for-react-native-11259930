**TASK1:** 

In task1, we were asked to create a JavaScript file named arrayManipulation.js. We then wrote a function processArray and passed on an argument(array of numbers). We then used a map() which create a new arrray by calling a function(processArray) on every element of the original array and storing the results in a new array.We were then asked to return a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled. That's when the if and else statement comes in.


**TASK2:**

In task2,we were asked to add a function formatArrayStrings to the file arrayManipulation.js. We then passed two arguments (An array of strings and An array of numbers processed by processArray). We then return the argument(array of strings) and passed two arguments which was the string and index so that the function modifies each string based on its corresponding number: Capitalize the entire string if the number is even and also Convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd. That's when we use the if and else statement.


**TASK3**
In task3, we were asked to create a new JavaScript file named userinfo.js. We were askwed to an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2 which returns an array of objects, each containing originalName, modifiedName, and id (auto-incremented starting from 1). So we used the map() and passed on the two arguments(name, index). We then returned the array of objects , each containing the originalName, modifiedName and id. They wanted the id to be auto-incremented starting from 1, so we used the counter=1 so it's starts from 1.
